> Cross-instance share page for Mastodon

[toot] allows you to share stuff on Mastodon, cross-instance. Just put in your
post text and the instance URL and click â€˜Toot!â€™

And if you open this page with `text` URL parameter, it will be auto-inserted
in the text field. The same goes for the `instance` URL parameter. This can be
used to build custom share buttons for Mastodon:

```html
<a href="https://toot.kytta.dev/?text=Hello%20world!&instance=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.xyz">
  Share on Mastodon
</a>
```

The instance URL can be saved in your `localStorage` to be automatically
appended later â€” handy!

## Hosting

### One-click Vercel deploy

For now, toot is a tad bit vendor-locked to run on
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/). To deploy it yourself, you can use the following
button:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkytta%2Ftoot)

### Host it yourself

Self-hosting toot outside of Vercel requires some extra setup:

1. Make sure you have got Node.js v12 or later as well as pnpm installed

2. Build the static part of toot:

   ```sh
   pnpm install    # to install dependencies
   pnpm run build  # to build the website
   ```

3. Run the backend server for the form:

   ```sh
   node api/toot.js
   ```

   or if you want to run the process in the background:

   ```sh
   pm2 start api/toot.js --watch --ignore-watch="node_modules"
   ```

   > You can find a summary for pm2 at: https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/

4. Set up webserver

   1. Apache

   ```apacheconf
   DocumentRoot "path_to_toot/public"

   ProxyPass "/api/toot"  "http://localhost:8000/"
   ```

   2. Nginx

   ```nginxconf
   root path_to_toot/public;
   index.html;

   location /api/toot {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/;
   }
   ```

   3. Caddy

   ```caddy
   root * path_to_toot/public;
   try_files index.html

   handle_path /api/toot {
      reverse_proxy localhost:8000
   }
   ```
